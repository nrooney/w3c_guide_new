# W3C Guide New Content
This repo is setup to design and write the content for the redesigned <w3.org/guide>. The currenty <w3.org/guide> site has a great deal of useful content but is outdated and suffers from a difficult UI. This repo aims to address only the content creation, and will leave the site redesign and layout to the W3C Team.

## Content Editors
Please see the [issues](https://github.com/nrooney/w3c_guide_new/issues) and find the issues assigned to you. You may pull this repo and work locally or use githubs editing tools and edit pages direct on github.

## Readers
