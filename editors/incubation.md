## Content
If you have a new idea or proposal for a W3C Recommendation or group then it is recommended that you take this idea through the process of "Incubation". Incubation is a process where you bring your idea to a special group within the W3C (WICG) to have it reviewed before beginning a new group, or start a Community Group (CG) as a way to show that there is industry support for your idea or proposal. See below for more information on these, and other, methods of incubation.
