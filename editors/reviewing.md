## Content
All W3C [RecTrack](https://github.com/nrooney/Guide/blob/master/mock/rectrack/index.md) Documents need to be reviewed. This page explains the review process, and how to reach out to the groups in charge of the reviewing for particular topics.

## Explainers
"Explainers" as a useful precursor to all forms of review, helping people orient themselves to the problem being solved and the proposed solution approach; useful in general, required for TAG review anyway. Good practice to do it sooner rather than later.

### Group Reviews
Group reviews occur throughout a RecTrack Document's time on the Recommendations Track. Please see the [RecTrack](https://github.com/nrooney/Guide/blob/master/mock/rectrack/index.md) pages to view when and how to hold RecTrack Reviews.
