Find information on attending group teleconferences below.

### Webex and Other Services
The W3C system for teleconferences is Webex. Prior to a teleconference meeting group members should receive Webex details from the chair or team contact. Webex can be joined via the web, via the Webex app or via the phone. Webex has dial in numbers for many countries around the world, see [here](#) for a list of the dial-in numbers.

####Â Other Systems
Sometimes a group will opt to use another teleconference system. This may be because the chair has use of a system at their workplace which they prefer to use. W3C allows this, but if any group members have as issue with this please let the chair or team contact know so they can encourage the chair to move to the Webex system. 

### IRC
@todo Add content and link to main IRC Page. Ask Nigel if there's a good IRC guide that he's seen targetted to participants.

### Speaking and Adding Items to an Agenda
To speak in a W3C teleconference add yourself to the queue by typing "q+" in IRC. The chair will see that you have been added to the speaking queue, and when it is your turn to speak the chair will call on you to speak.

If you wish to have an item added to the agenda please email your group mailing list previously, or let yuor chair know at the beginning of the meeting. Different chairs run meetings in different ways, so chairs may encourage you to take your item to the mailing list or wait till a later meeting. If you have any issues with these decisions feel free to speak to your team contact.

### Calendar Invites
Calendar invites are rarely sent for W3C meetings. It is up to the participant to add the invite using their calendar tool when they receive an email from their chair / team contact regarding the next group meeting. If you have issues with the process please email your group team contact.
