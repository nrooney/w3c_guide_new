The W3C system for teleconferences is Webex. Prior to a teleconference meeting group members should receive Webex details from the chair or team contact. Webex can be joined via the web, via the Webex app or via the phone. Webex has dial in numbers for many countries around the world, see [here](#) for a list of the dial-in numbers.

###Â Other Systems
Sometimes a group will opt to use another teleconference system. This may be because the chair has use of a system at their workplace which they prefer to use. W3C allows this, but if any group members have as issue with this please let the chair or team contact know so they can encourage the chair to move to the Webex system.
